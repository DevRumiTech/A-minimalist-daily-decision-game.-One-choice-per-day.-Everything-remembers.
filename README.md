AFTERMATH

One choice per day. Everything remembers.

AFTERMATH is a minimalist daily decision experience.
Each day, the player makes exactly one irreversible choice.
The system remembers every decision and quietly shapes what comes next.

There is no win condition. Only outcomes.

How it works

- One real-world choice per day
- Choices are permanent
- Hidden long-term state (no visible stats)
- Narrative consequences appear over time
- Progress is stored locally in the browser
- Designed for slow, repeat visits

If it feels quiet or confusing at first, that is intentional.
